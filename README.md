# Entropy Probes

Investigating whether LLMs have internal representations of their own uncertainty, and whether they access these representations during meta-cognitive tasks like reporting confidence.

## Goal

Test the hypothesis that LLMs genuinely introspect on their uncertainty rather than just pattern-matching on surface features. The core workflow:

1. **Identify**: Find internal correlates of output uncertainty (entropy, logit_gap, etc.)
2. **Transfer**: Test whether these correlates appear during meta-judgment tasks (confidence reports, delegation decisions)
   - D→M transfer: Does d_mc_uncertainty from the MC task predict uncertainty in meta-task activations?
   - M→D prediction: Can we find a direction in meta activations that predicts MC uncertainty? Is it the same as d_mc? (metamcuncert approach)
3. **Causality**: Verify the relationship is causal via ablation and steering
4. **Interpret**: Understand what the uncertainty direction represents (logit lens, direction similarity)

## Quick Start

Edit the `MODEL`, `DATASET`, and `META_TASK` constants at the top of each script, then run the stages in order:

```bash
# Stage 1: Find uncertainty + answer directions
python -m experiments.directions.identify_mc_correlate

# Stage 2: Test transfer to meta-task + find confidence directions
python -m experiments.transfer.test_meta_transfer

# Stage 3: Causal tests
python -m experiments.interventions.run_ablation_causality
python -m experiments.interventions.run_steering_causality

# Stage 4: Interpret directions
python -m analysis.directions.analyze_directions
# Historical helper: archive/compare_direction_types.py

# Summary: Cross-stage consolidated view
# Historical helper: archive/summarize_results.py
```

Each script prints comprehensive results to console and saves JSON + PNG outputs.

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Identify uncertainty directions

Find directions in activation space that correlate with output uncertainty.

**MC task** (multiple choice questions):
```bash
python -m experiments.directions.identify_mc_correlate
```

Finds both uncertainty directions (probe + mean_diff methods) and optionally answer directions (A/B/C/D classification). 

**Next-token task** (diverse text):
```bash
python -m experiments.directions.identify_nexttoken_correlate
```

Requires a stratified dataset from `experiments/data/build_nexttoken_dataset.py`. Finds uncertainty directions and optionally output token directions (which token the model selected). 

Both scripts extract activations, compute uncertainty metrics, find directions using two methods (probe and mean_diff), and report per-layer R² with bootstrap 95% CIs.

### Stage 2: Test meta-transfer

Test whether directions found on the direct task transfer to meta-judgments:

```bash
python -m experiments.transfer.test_meta_transfer
```

Loads directions from Stage 1 and tests how well they predict uncertainty from meta-task activations (confidence rating or delegation game). Reports:
- Behavioral correlation (stated confidence vs actual uncertainty) with bootstrap CIs
- D→D and D→M R² per layer with CIs
- Transfer ratio (best D→M / best D→D) with introspection strength interpretation
- Answer direction analysis

Optional direction-finding from meta-task activations:
- `FIND_CONFIDENCE_DIRECTIONS = True`: Find directions predicting stated confidence
- `FIND_MC_UNCERTAINTY_DIRECTIONS = True`: Find directions in meta-task activations that predict MC uncertainty (the "metamcuncert" directions)

The metamcuncert approach is a key introspection test: we find directions in the model's meta-task activations (when it's being asked about confidence) that predict its actual MC-task uncertainty. These can then be compared via cosine similarity to the original d_mc_uncertainty to test whether the same geometric representation is used in both contexts.

### Stage 3: Causal tests

**Ablation** (necessity):
```bash
python -m experiments.interventions.run_ablation_causality
```

Ablates directions during meta-task inference and measures if calibration degrades. Tests all layers with FDR correction and bootstrap CIs on effect sizes.

**Steering** (sufficiency):
```bash
python -m experiments.interventions.run_steering_causality
```

Steers along directions at graded magnitudes and measures dose-response. Significant slopes with correct sign indicate causal sufficiency.

**Activation patching** (full activation):
```bash
python -m experiments.interventions.run_activation_patching
```

Pairs questions by metric value in MC tasks (e.g., low-entropy source ↔ high-entropy target) and swaps complete activation vectors between them during meta task inference. At each tested layer, the source question's hidden state is replaced with the target's activations. If the source's behavior shifts toward the target's uncertainty profile, this demonstrates that full activations (not just a 1D direction) causally encode uncertainty.

Both ablation and steering test probe and mean_diff methods, and support `DIRECTION_TYPE`:
- `"uncertainty"`: MC uncertainty directions (d_mc_uncertainty from identify_mc_correlate.py)
- `"answer"`: MC answer directions (A/B/C/D from identify_mc_correlate.py)
- `"confidence"`: Stated confidence directions (from test_meta_transfer.py)
- `"metamcuncert"`: MC uncertainty directions found from meta activations (from test_meta_transfer.py with `FIND_MC_UNCERTAINTY_DIRECTIONS = True`)

**Cross-direction causality** (internal effects):
```bash
python -m experiments.interventions.run_cross_direction_causality
```

Tests whether ablating one direction type affects the activation projection onto other direction types. For example: does ablating answer directions reduce the projection onto uncertainty directions? This measures internal representational causality rather than behavioral output effects. Reports effect matrix with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction.

**Visualize single ablation effect:**
```bash
python -m analysis.interventions.plot_ablation_effect uncertainty confidence 14
```

Creates a two-panel figure showing the effect of ablating one direction on another:
- Panel 1: Raw projection trajectories across layers (baseline vs post-ablation)
- Panel 2: Delta with error bars (significance indicator - bars not crossing zero = significant)

Useful for examining specific ablation effects in detail after running cross-direction causality.

### Stage 4: Interpret

**Logit lens + direction analysis:**
```bash
python -m analysis.directions.analyze_directions
```

Projects directions through the unembedding matrix to see what tokens they correspond to. Reports direction similarity across experiment types.

**Direction type comparison:**
```bash
# Historical helper: archive/compare_direction_types.py
```

Compares uncertainty, answer, and confidence directions via cosine similarity. Reports bootstrap CIs on mean cosine.

### Stage 5: Causal ordering analysis

Test whether MC uncertainty representations appear in meta-task activations *before* meta output uncertainty and confidence representations—as predicted if MC uncertainty causally drives meta-judgments via those vectors.

```bash
python -m analysis.interventions.analyze_causal_ordering
```

**Rationale**: If the model's MC uncertainty causally influences its meta-judgment (e.g., confidence rating) via the identified meta output uncertainty and/or confidence vectors, then
MC uncertainty signal should appear in **earlier** layers

The script plots R² vs layer for four signals:
- **D→M transfer**: MC direction applied to meta activations (tests if same direction transfers)
- **mcuncert**: Direction in meta activations that predicts MC uncertainty (tests if any direction encodes it)
- **metauncert**: Direction predicting uncertainty over meta-task output options
- **confdir**: Direction predicting stated confidence

If MC signals peak before meta signals, this is consistent with MC uncertainty being causal. If they peak at the same layer or confdir peaks first, this argues against the causal hypothesis.

### Direction comparison across datasets and tasks

Compare all 12 "output uncertainty" directions to each other:

```bash
python -m analysis.directions.compare_uncertainty_directions
```

Computes a 12×12 cosine similarity matrix comparing:
- MC entropy directions (3): one per dataset
- Meta output entropy directions (9): 3 datasets × 3 meta tasks (self, other, delegate)

Key questions answered:
- Are MC entropy directions consistent across datasets?
- Are meta output entropy directions consistent across datasets?
- How similar are MC entropy vs meta output entropy directions?
- Does the delegate task find a different direction than self/other confidence tasks?

Also see `analysis/directions/compare_directions_cross_dataset.py` for comparing specific direction types across datasets with consensus vector computation.

### Cross-stage summary

```bash
# Historical helper: archive/summarize_results.py
```

Reads all `*_results.json` files for a given model/dataset and produces a compact cross-stage console summary plus a unified `*_summary.json`.

## Direction-Finding Methods

Two fundamentally different approaches, with variants for continuous vs categorical targets:

### Continuous targets (uncertainty metrics, confidence)

| Method | How it works | Strengths |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `probe` | Ridge regression: find direction `w` minimizing `\|\|Xw - y\|\|²` | Optimized for prediction; uses all data points |
| `mean_diff` | `mean(top 25%) - mean(bottom 25%)` | Simple, interpretable; focuses on extremes |

### Categorical targets (answer prediction: A/B/C/D)

| Method | How it works | Strengths |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| `probe` | Logistic regression classifier | Optimized for classification accuracy |
| `centroid` | Per-class centroids; classify by nearest centroid | Simple, interpretable; no optimization |

The `centroid` method computes the mean activation for each answer class (A, B, C, D) and classifies test samples by which centroid they're closest to. It's the categorical analogue of `mean_diff`—both are non-optimized methods based on group means.

### Interpretation

When comparing directions across tasks (e.g., "do confidence directions align with uncertainty directions?"):
- Comparing `probe↔probe` or `mean_diff↔mean_diff` is apples-to-apples (same method, different tasks)
- Comparing `probe↔mean_diff` for the *same* task tells you whether both methods found the same structure
- Low agreement between methods suggests the target doesn't have a single clean linear direction

Both methods are computed automatically and compared in every stage.

## Shared Parameters

These constants must match across scripts for consistent results:

| Parameter | Default | Used by |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `SEED` | `42` | All scripts |
| `PROBE_ALPHA` | `1000.0` | identify_mc, identify_nexttoken, test_meta, test_cross_dataset |
| `PROBE_PCA_COMPONENTS` | `100` | identify_mc, identify_nexttoken, test_meta, test_cross_dataset |
| `TRAIN_SPLIT` | `0.8` | identify_mc, identify_nexttoken, test_meta, test_cross_dataset, ablation, steering |
| `MEAN_DIFF_QUANTILE` | `0.25` | identify_mc, identify_nexttoken, test_meta, test_cross_dataset |

These are marked with `# Must match across scripts` in each file's constant block.

## Output Naming Convention

All outputs use the prefix `{model_short}_{dataset}` where `model_short` is derived from the HuggingFace model name (e.g., `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`). When quantization is enabled, a suffix is appended (e.g., `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_4bit`).

For causality outputs, `{dir_suffix}` encodes the direction type: `uncertainty_{metric}` for uncertainty directions, or just the direction type name for others (e.g., `answer`, `confidence`, `metamcuncert`).

## Metrics

All computed automatically:

| Metric | Formula | Higher means | Linear? |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `entropy` | -Σ(p log p) | More uncertain | No |
| `top_prob` | max(p) | More confident | No |
| `margin` | p₁ - p₂ | More confident | No |
| `logit_gap` | z₁ - z₂ | More confident | Yes |
| `top_logit` | z₁ - mean(z) | More confident | Yes |

Linear metrics (logit_gap, top_logit) are generally better targets for linear probes.

## Visualization

All plotting uses centralized helpers from `core/plotting.py`. Colors, figure sizes, DPI, grid style, CI band opacity, and marker styles are defined once and used by all scripts. To change how plots look:

- **Colors**: Edit `METHOD_COLORS`, `DIRECTION_COLORS`, `TASK_COLORS`, `SIGNIFICANCE_COLORS`, `CONDITION_COLORS`
- **Figure sizes**: Edit `SINGLE_PANEL`, `TWO_PANEL_WIDE`, `THREE_PANEL_WIDE`, etc.
- **Styling**: Edit `DPI`, `GRID_ALPHA`, `CI_ALPHA`, `MARKER_SIZE`, `LINE_WIDTH`

Scripts compose figures using helpers like `plot_layer_metric()`, `mark_significant_layers()`, `save_figure()`, etc.

## Datasets

Source datasets in `data/`:

| Dataset | Questions | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| PopMC | 14,267 | Popular culture MC questions |
| SimpleMC | 500 | Simple factual MC questions |
| TriviaMC | 2,416 | Trivia MC questions |

Experiments sample `NUM_QUESTIONS` (default 500) from these sources.

### Difficulty Filtering

To create balanced correct/incorrect subsets for better signal variance:

```bash
python -m experiments.data.filter_by_difficulty
```

Creates `data/TriviaMC_difficulty_filtered.jsonl` with 250 correct + 250 incorrect questions. Then use normally:

```python
# identify_mc_correlate.py
DATASET = "TriviaMC_difficulty_filtered"
```

## Archive

Legacy, debug, and one-off scripts are in `archive/` with an `archive/README.md` explaining their provenance. Pre-modification snapshots of scripts changed during the consolidation are in `archive/originals/`.
